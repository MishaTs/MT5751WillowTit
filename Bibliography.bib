	abstract = {Inferences based on counts adjusted for detectability represent a marked improvement over unadjusted counts, which provide no information about true population density and rely on untestable and unrealistic assumptions about constant detectability for inferring differences in density over time or space. Distance sampling is a widely used method to estimate detectability and therefore density. In the standard method, we model the probability of detecting a bird as a function of distance alone. Here, we describe methods that allow us to model probability of detection as a function of additional covariates—an approach available in DISTANCE, version 5.0 (Thomas et al. 2005) but still not widely applied. The main use of these methods is to increase the reliability of density estimates made on subsets of the whole data (e.g., estimates for different habitats, treatments, periods, or species), to increase precision of density estimates or to allow inferences about the covariates themselves. We present a case study of the use of multiple covariates in an analysis of a point-transect survey of Hawaii Amakihi (Hemignathus virens).Amélioration des estimations de densité d’oiseaux par l’utilisation de l’échantillonnage par la distance avec covariables multiples},

	abstract = {Horvitz-Thompson estimators based on estimated inclusion probabilities are developed for line transect surveys in which some of the central assumptions of conventional line transect theory fail. The estimators are designed to accommodate uncertain detection of animals in the observers' path simultaneously with dependence of detection probabilities on explanatory variables other than perpendicular distance. They require that data be collected by two observer teams simultaneously searching the survey region, recording for each detection both positional data and details of any other variables that may affect detectability. One of the estimators is designed to correct for responsive animal movement. This method requires that the primary observer team searches independently of the secondary team, whereas the second estimator requires both observer teams to search independently of each other. The methods can be viewed as specific forms of mark-recapture experiments, in which individual capture probabilities are modelled as functions of observable explanatory variables and in which animals detected by both observer teams correspond to recaptures. They differ from existing mark-recapture Horvitz-Thompson estimators primarily in that they use an assumption about the distribution of perpendicular distances that is implicit in conventional line transect estimators. One of the estimators is used to estimate harbour porpoise abundance in the North Sea from a dual-platform line transect survey.},
